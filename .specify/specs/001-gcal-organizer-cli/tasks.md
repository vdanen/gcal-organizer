## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

```mermaid
graph TD
    P1[Phase 1: Setup] --> P2[Phase 2: Foundational]
    P2 --> P3[Phase 3: US5 - Run Workflow]
    P2 --> P4[Phase 4: US1 - Organize]
    P2 --> P5[Phase 5: US2 - Calendar Sync]
    P2 --> P6[Phase 6: US3 - AI Extract]
    P3 --> P7[Phase 7: US4 - Create Tasks]
    P4 --> P7
    P6 --> P7
    P7 --> P8[Phase 8: Polish]
```

### Critical Path

1. **T001-T006**: Setup (required first)
2. **T007-T016**: Foundational (blocks all user stories)
3. **T017-T021**: US5 scaffold (enables testing other stories)
4. **T022-T028**: US1 (core organizing)
5. **T036-T044**: US3 (Gemini extraction - key differentiator)
6. **T045-T049**: US4 (task creation - completes loop)

### Parallel Opportunities

Once Phase 2 complete, these can run in parallel:
- US1 (T022-T028) and US2 (T029-T035) are independent
- US1 and US3 can start in parallel (different services)

---

## Notes

- All [P] tasks can run in parallel within their phase
- Test files should be created alongside implementation
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Use `--dry-run` extensively during development to avoid side effects
- OAuth tokens stored in `~/.gcal-organizer/token.json`
